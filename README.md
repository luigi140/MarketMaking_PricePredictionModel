## Key Features

### Introduction
- Utilizes seminal work of McLean and Pontiff (2016) to identify effective market signals.
- Focuses on predictive signals categorized into Event, Market, Valuation, and Fundamental types.

### Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Collects historical trade data using yfinance.
- Cleans and preprocesses data to ensure readiness for analysis.

### Feature Engineering
- Identifies and derives key features that impact market movements, such as 52-Week High, Momentum, Volume Trend, and Beta.

### Model Development
- Trains various ML models including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, RandomForest, GradientBoosting, and XGBoost.
- Employs feature selection with cross-validation to prevent overfitting and ensure robustness.

### Understanding the Results
- Analyzes model performance through metrics like RÂ² and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- Selects Ridge Regression as the optimal model due to its balance of high predictive power and regularization capabilities.

### Backtesting
- Implements a backtesting strategy to evaluate model performance using historical data.
- Simulates trading strategies (buy, short) and calculates annualized returns.

### Portfolio Construction and Performance Evaluation
- Constructs a weighted portfolio using PyPortfolioOpt.
- Compares optimized portfolio performance against the S&P 500 on return, volatility, and Sharpe ratio.

## Conclusion and Next Steps
- Demonstrates skills in quantitative research, model development, portfolio construction, and financial acumen.
- Suggests areas for improvement, such as incorporating multiple data sources and sentiment analysis, refining model training, and developing trading strategies.

## Requirements
- Python libraries: yfinance, pandas, numpy, statsmodels, scikit-learn, xgboost, joblib, matplotlib, seaborn, cvxpy, PyPortfolioOpt.

This project highlights a comprehensive approach to developing a market-making algorithm, offering insights into the practical application of machine learning in quantitative finance.
